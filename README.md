# Advent of Koka
This is my attempt at doing 2022's Advent of Code in [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html). My goal is to upload solutions for each day's problem on the day of release, but that might not happen.

I do not claim that any of these are the most efficient solutions. I'm making an effort to write reasonably efficient solutions, but the main goal of this exercise is to experience writing code in Koka.

## Update

I've made the foolish mistake of having a life during the holidays, and I'm no longer able to dedicate enough time to solve these as they come out. I may sporadically solve a problem or two, but I make no commitments.

## Update 2

I've decided to finish up some library work and attempt this again for 2023. However, unlike in 2022, I will make no attempt to keep up with the release of new problems. Instead, I'm only going to solve problems when and while I'm enjoying it.
